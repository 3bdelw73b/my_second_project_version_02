Problem_01 ( Header )
    - Why the header scroll when we display the hidden box ? ( because of applying the overflow property )
    - ( overflow: auto; is almost overflow: scroll; )
    - we _here_ want to display the box outside the header so we have to allow the overflow content.

Know that: 
    - color used for icons is: #6f1d1b
    - background-color used for divs is: #99582a
    - color used for normal text is: #333
    - color used for borders is: #6f1d1b or white

Problem_02:
    - when we hover the book, the transform process is done during 100ms ( for example ).
    - when we cancel the hover, the reverse transform process is done in 500ms ( how can we do it ? ).
Solution:
    - write the line ( transition: 500ms; ) for the element itself ( book_logo ), no just for its parent hover case ( book:hover book_logo ).

Problem_03:
    - in the services section, how can we display the icon from bottom to top ?
